main:
- open the input txt file into buffer
- parse the input file into a matrix 9X9
- check working mode and call the right function.
- receive the solution from the called function
- write the solution into a text file

Solver
- parse the input file into a matrix and count the amount of missing  (no of iterations needed)

do the following while not stuck(stuck flag or if no of itterations is the same for two rounds):
- pass through every elemnt:
		# if number -> ignore
		# if dot -> check possible numbers 
if stuck: exit and write output as error
